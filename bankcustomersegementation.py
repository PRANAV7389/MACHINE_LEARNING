"""

### Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters: Elbow Method and Silhouette Score

To find the optimal number of clusters (k) for the K-Means algorithm, we use two common methods: the Elbow Method and the Silhouette Score.

**Elbow Method:** This method looks at the total within-cluster sum of squares (inertia) as a function of the number of clusters. As the number of clusters increases, the inertia decreases. The "elbow point" on the plot of inertia versus k is considered the optimal k, where the rate of decrease sharply changes.

**Silhouette Score:** This metric measures how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). The silhouette score ranges from -1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters. We aim for a k that maximizes the average silhouette score.

"""**Reasoning**:
The previous attempt to create a markdown cell using `code_block` resulted in a `SyntaxError`. I need to use the appropriate method for creating markdown cells. Since I cannot directly create a markdown cell, I will skip this step and move on to the next step in the instructions, which is to add comments to the code cell that plots the inertia and silhouette scores. This plot helps in visualizing the results of the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.


"""

# Create a figure for the Elbow Method plot

"""**Reasoning**:
Based on the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score plots, I will summarize the findings to determine the optimal number of clusters. The Elbow Method shows a bend around k=4, and the Silhouette Score is highest at k=3 and then drops and stabilizes with minor fluctuations. Considering both, k=4 seems like a reasonable choice as the silhouette score is still relatively high and the inertia curve shows a noticeable decrease up to this point. I will add a markdown cell to explain this observation and the rationale for choosing k=4.


"""

### Interpreting the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score Plots

The **Elbow Method** plot shows a significant decrease in inertia as the number of clusters (k) increases from 2 to 4. After k=4, the rate of decrease slows down, forming an "elbow" shape around k=4. This suggests that adding more clusters beyond 4 does not significantly reduce the within-cluster sum of squares.

The **Silhouette Score** plot shows the highest score at k=3, followed by a dip at k=4 and then some fluctuations. While k=3 has the highest silhouette score, the Elbow Method strongly indicates k=4 as a point of diminishing returns in terms of inertia reduction.

Considering both methods, **k=4** is chosen as a reasonable number of clusters. The Elbow Method provides a clearer indication of a good balance between minimizing inertia and the number of clusters.

"""**Reasoning**:
The previous attempts to create markdown cells using `code_block` have failed. I will proceed with adding comments to the code cell that fits the K-Means model with k=4 and displays the cluster centers, and the code cell that creates the `data_final` DataFrame. This aligns with the next steps in the instructions. I will skip adding markdown cells for now.
